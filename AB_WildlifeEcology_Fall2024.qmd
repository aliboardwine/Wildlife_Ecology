**1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

A sample size of 59 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence.

**2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

A sample size of 299 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 1% prevalence with a 95% confidence interval.

**b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

A sample size of 229 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 2% prevalence with a 99% confidence interval.

**3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is** \_\_\<\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
\>) \_\_1\_\_%.

**4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
Russell counties).\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**

Chambers: Prevalence = 27%, Lower CL = 13%, Upper CL = 45%

Lee: Prevalence = 20%, Lower CL = 14%, Upper CL = 27%

Russell: Prevalence = 3%, Lower CL = 0.9%, Upper CL = 8.7%\

**b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.**

Chambers: 27%

Lee: 20%

Russell: 3%

P- Value \< 0.0001

Since the P-Value \< 0.05, the test is statistically significant. The null hypothesis should be rejected.

### 10/02/24 Worksheet 4

Disease models are essential tools that provide valuable insights to disease dynamics. Those insights can then be used to make informed wildlife management decisions leading to better wildlife management strategies. The Starfield essay even states that modeling is an imperative practice for good decision making as long as it is used usefully and efficiently. These models are able to simulate and predict the level of spread and impact in wildlife diseases mathematically and statistically. Since they are able to be programmed to simulate multiple scenarios, wildlife managers can test different interventions to observe resulting impacts on the population. For example, a model could predict how a disease outbreak responds to a certain number of animals being vaccinated.

It is important to remember that disease models a more of a representation, and should not be taken as factual, since there are multiple limitations involved with their capabilities. Obtaining data in the field is extremely difficult given the environment and limited technological capabilities with wildlife data collection. If the data going into the model is incomplete, then the model will be inaccurate. The primary problem with data uncertainty is the lack of reliable data. It is heightened when measuring wildlife data so wildlife disease managers should not rely solely on one data collection method or the model’s predictions. Diseases in wildlife are influenced by a number of environmental factors including behavior changes in the animals or changes in the habitat. Ecological interactions are constantly evolving and changing and there is no possible way of including all of these possible changes into a model’s parameters.

Disease models should be used alongside other tools for making wildlife disease management decisions because of the limitations previously explained. Laboratory studies have always been used to test hypotheses and can be a tool when studying pathogens. Being able to characterize the spread of the disease in the lab can be transferred to real-world application. To get a better idea of the environment that the disease is spreading in, field sampling and surveys can be done. Field work always entails some kind of observations which is perhaps the first tool used for making wildlife disease management decisions. Integrating epidemiological models with ecological models could enhance their predictability and power, improving some of the limitations associated with the individual models. All of these tools can be used in tandem with disease models, but they can also be used to improve disease models by continuously updating the parameters. By updating the parameters of the models to more closely resemble the realistic ecological interactions and environment, the model will be more accurate in its predictions.

The Starfield essay argued that disease models were essential to successful environmental management decisions and interventions, even going so far as to saying that small, pragmatic models will become a part of wildlife professional’s everyday lives. Encouraging professionals to integrate models into their practices is difficult, but it will greatly enhance the success rate of disease interventions. In conclusion, disease models provide useful templates for testing intervention strategies on a population, but they do have some limitations. Using models with other tools like laboratory testing, field observations, and integrating multiple models, can improve its reliability and improve wildlife disease management outcomes.

**12) Bonus**

P = 5400(0.50) = 2700 adults and 2700 juveniles

I = 2700(0.40) = 1080 adults immune

VC = 1 - 1/R0 = 1 - 1/3 = 0.67 = 67%

5400(0.67) = 3618 - 1080 = 2538

2538 seals should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity when R0=3.

### 10/27/24 Fecal Flotation Lab Activity

The purpose of doing these fecal flotations was to identify Helmiths parasites in dairy cows. Fecal flotations are done on freshly acquired fecal matter to count the number of parasitic eggs to determine the estimated number of total parasites in the animal. This information can be used to recommend when these animals are dewormed and how often.

The procedure of these fecal flotations are as follows. 2 grams of fecal matter is weighed out in a cup. Then 13 mL of tap water is added to the fecal matter and the slurry is mixed well. The slurry is passed through a strainer to separate the larger solid pieces and then transferred into a 50 mL tube. 1 mL of sugar solution is placed into a 5 mL tube and a total of 1 mL of fecal slurry is added after being mixed in a vortex. The specific gravity of the solution depends on the density of the parasite. This sugar solution's specific gravity is 1.27 which allows for the Helmiths eggs to float to the top of the solution. The solution in the 5 mL tube is mixed well then used to fill an egg counting slide which has two grids on either side. Both chambers were filled using a pipette and left for five minutes to let the eggs float to the top of the slide to be counted. Under a microscope, the number of eggs in each block was counted. Each egg counted in this 1 mL sample equates to 50 eggs per gram of feces.

This calculations allows you to determine if the level of parasite infection is problematic and if/how often the animal should be dewormed. In this case, you cannot tell the exact species of the parasitic worm from the eggs, you have to do DNA testing.

### 11/5/24 Worksheet 6 Marburg Virus Outbreak

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of today, 65 cases of Marburg virus infection have been documented, and most of the people infected are health care workers, mainly those who work in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

I would classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event according to the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pederson. Spillover events occur when a virus is transmitted to a species that it does not normally affect. In this case, the first case of Marburg virus in humans was contracted during exposure to Eqyptian rousette bats. These bats are known reservoirs of the Marburg virus meaning they can transmit it. Once this virus infected the first human, it was easily spread Rwanda. Following this sequence, the Marburg virus outbreak is a spillover event because it jumps from animal reservoir to humans.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

In community settings, there should be an increase in surveillance of cases and transmission routes. Doing this will identify potential cases sooner to limit the spread of the virus. Closing off all entrances to the caves and stopping all exposures to the bats will prevent the original spillover to occur again. Making the public aware that this is a danger to the community and teaching them proper hygiene techniques should prevent some from getting infected with the virus.

In healthcare settings, proper personal protective equipment should be worn at all times when working with any Marburg virus cases. Proper training should also be done to allow the staff to be knowledgeable on how to handle infectious disease outbreaks and highly contagious viruses. Separating infected patients from others will prevent the spread of the virus in the hospital and stop other people and healthcare workers from getting infected.

### 11/21/24 Worksheet 7, 8, 9 

Table 1. Prevalence values and confidence level for *B. procyonis* in raccoons of each region.

| Region  | Prevalence | Lower CL | Upper CL |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| North   | 28.6%      | 17.0%    | 42.8%    |
| South   | 62.8%      | 47.7%    | 75.9%    |
| Central | 64.3%      | 37.1%    | 84.7%    |

Two-sided p-value: 0.0016

A Fisher's exact test was use to perform a comparison of prevalence values for each each region: North, South, and Central. By doing this, a two-sided p-value was also calculated. In addition to this, the confidence levels were found for each region using Sterne's method. From the results in Table 1, the prevalence of *B. procyonis* in raccoons in the North region is significantly less than the prevalence values for the South and Central regions. The South and Central region prevalence values are fairly similar. In the real world, raccoons in northern regions could be less susceptible to infection of *B. procyonis* because of environmental factors like a cooler climate. Since the P-Value \< 0.05, the test is statistically significant. The null hypothesis should be rejected.

Table 2. Prevalence values and confidence level for *B. procyonis* in raccoons of each sex.

| Sex    | Prevalence | Lower CL | Upper CL |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| Male   | 37.7%      | 26.7%    | 50.0%    |
| Female | 64.9%      | 48.6%    | 78.6%    |

Two-sided p-value: 0.0087

A Fisher's exact test was use to perform a comparison of prevalence values for the sex of raccoons. By doing this, a two-sided p-value was also calculated. In addition to this, the confidence levels were found for each sex using Sterne's method. From the results in Table 2, the prevalence of *B. procyonis* in male raccoons is much lower than that of female raccoons. Female raccoons could be more susceptible to infection. Since the P-Value \< 0.05, the test is statistically significant. The null hypothesis should be rejected.

Table 3. Prevalence values and confidence level for *B. procyonis* in raccoons of each age group.

| Age Group   | Prevalence | Lower CL | Upper CL |
|-------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Adult       | 52.2%      | 40.4%    | 63.8%    |
| Young Adult | 37.8%      | 23.4%    | 54.1%    |

Two-sided p-value: 0.2206

A Fisher's exact test was use to perform a comparison of prevalence values for each age group of raccoons. By doing this, a two-sided p-value was also calculated. In addition to this, the confidence levels were found for each age group using Sterne's method. From the results in Table 3, it appears that the prevalence of *B. procyonis* is lower in the young adult age group populations when compared to that of the adult age group population. However, because the p-value is \> 0.05, this test is not statistically significant. Therefore, this conclusions cannot be made. A difference in age groups might not affect a raccoon's susceptibility of infection.

Overall these tests highlight patterns of high worm counts, or *B. procyonis* prevalence, in female raccoons and in southern and central regions. Males and those in northern regions have much lower worm counts or *B. procyonis* prevalence values. The parasites might have mutated to be more capable of infecting female raccoon hosts or be more active in warmer climates.
