Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualizations. For your assignments and worksheets, using Quarto will allow you to seamlessly integrate your analysis with your written explanations/comments, making your reports more cohesive and professional.

### Integrating Text and Code

Find the area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

### 09/16/24 Worksheet 2 & 3

<https://github.com/aliboardwine/Wildlife_Ecology/blob/main/ss_table.png>

**1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**

A sample size of 59 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence.

**2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

A sample size of 299 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 1% prevalence with a 95% confidence interval.

**b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

A sample size of 229 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 2% prevalence with a 99% confidence interval.

**3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is** \_\_\<\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
\>) \_\_1\_\_%.

**4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
Russell counties).\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**

Chambers: Prevalence = 27%, Lower CL = 13%, Upper CL = 45%

Lee: Prevalence = 20%, Lower CL = 14%, Upper CL = 27%

Russell: Prevalence = 3%, Lower CL = 0.9%, Upper CL = 8.7%\

**b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.**

Chambers: 27%

Lee: 20%

Russell: 3%

P- Value \< 0.0001

Since the P-Value \< 0.05, the test is statistically significant. The null hypothesis should be rejected.

**5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).\

<https://github.com/aliboardwine/Wildlife_Ecology/blob/main/Question%205%20on%20Worksheet%202%20%26%203.png>

**a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.**\
Day 1: 3/60 = 0.05 cases per fish-day

Day 2: 1/57 = 0.02 cases per fish-day

Day 5: 9/49 = 0.18 cases per fish-day

**b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?**\
Day 3: 7/56 = 0.12

Day 5: 20/49 = 0.33

**c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?**\
Day 1 is when prevalence is the same as incidence (=0.05).

### 10/02/24 Worksheet 4

Disease models are essential tools that provide valuable insights to disease dynamics. Those insights can then be used to make informed wildlife management decisions leading to better wildlife management strategies. The Starfield essay even states that modeling is an imperative practice for good decision making as long as it is used usefully and efficiently. These models are able to simulate and predict the level of spread and impact in wildlife diseases mathematically and statistically. Since they are able to be programmed to simulate multiple scenarios, wildlife managers can test different interventions to observe resulting impacts on the population. For example, a model could predict how a disease outbreak responds to a certain number of animals being vaccinated.

It is important to remember that disease models a more of a representation, and should not be taken as factual, since there are multiple limitations involved with their capabilities. Obtaining data in the field is extremely difficult given the environment and limited technological capabilities with wildlife data collection. If the data going into the model is incomplete, then the model will be inaccurate. The primary problem with data uncertainty is the lack of reliable data. It is heightened when measuring wildlife data so wildlife disease managers should not rely solely on one data collection method or the model’s predictions. Diseases in wildlife are influenced by a number of environmental factors including behavior changes in the animals or changes in the habitat. Ecological interactions are constantly evolving and changing and there is no possible way of including all of these possible changes into a model’s parameters.

Disease models should be used alongside other tools for making wildlife disease management decisions because of the limitations previously explained. Laboratory studies have always been used to test hypotheses and can be a tool when studying pathogens. Being able to characterize the spread of the disease in the lab can be transferred to real-world application. To get a better idea of the environment that the disease is spreading in, field sampling and surveys can be done. Field work always entails some kind of observations which is perhaps the first tool used for making wildlife disease management decisions. Integrating epidemiological models with ecological models could enhance their predictability and power, improving some of the limitations associated with the individual models. All of these tools can be used in tandem with disease models, but they can also be used to improve disease models by continuously updating the parameters. By updating the parameters of the models to more closely resemble the realistic ecological interactions and environment, the model will be more accurate in its predictions.

The Starfield essay argued that disease models were essential to successful environmental management decisions and interventions, even going so far as to saying that small, pragmatic models will become a part of wildlife professional’s everyday lives. Encouraging professionals to integrate models into their practices is difficult, but it will greatly enhance the success rate of disease interventions. In conclusion, disease models provide useful templates for testing intervention strategies on a population, but they do have some limitations. Using models with other tools like laboratory testing, field observations, and integrating multiple models, can improve its reliability and improve wildlife disease management outcomes.

**4b)** **Name the dead-end host for *Dicrocoelium dendriticum*.** There is no dead-end host.

**7c)** **Estimate the upper bound of prevalence for exposure to *T. gondii* each of these populations. Also. provide the confidence level for these prevalence values.**

Seal Bay: 3/98 = 0.03, \<3% with 95% confidence

Olive Island: 3/65 = 0.045, \<5% with 95% confidence

Dangerous Reef: 3/21 = 0.14, \<14% with 95% confidence

**8a)** **Which year has the highest incidence for deer fibroma? Make sure you write appropriate unit for incidence value.**

Year 2020: 0/(220-6) = 0 cases per deer-year.

Year 2020 has the lowest incidence value of 0 cases per deer-year.

**8b) When is prevalence lowest? Write unit for prevalence if applicable.**

Year 2015: (3+0)/225 = 0.013

Year 2015 has the lowest prevalence of 0.013.

**12) Bonus**

P = 5400(0.50) = 2700 adults and 2700 juveniles

I = 2700(0.40) = 1080 adults immune

VC = 1 - 1/R0 = 1 - 1/3 = 0.67 = 67%

5400(0.67) = 3618 - 1080 = 2538

2538 seals should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity when R0=3.
